### ðŸ§  Deep Learning Journey â€” From Perceptrons to Neural Networks

This repository is my personal notebook for learning **Deep Learning** from the ground up.  
It starts with the basics â€” like implementing a **Perceptron model from scratch** using NumPy â€” and will gradually grow to include more advanced concepts like **multi-layer neural networks, activation functions, backpropagation**, and more.

### ðŸ’» What's inside:
- âœ… `perceptron.py` â€” custom implementation of the perceptron learning algorithm.
- ðŸ“˜ Code + comments to help understand the intuition behind the math.
- ðŸš§ Upcoming: Neural nets, activation functions, loss functions, and training workflows.

### ðŸ”¥ Why this repo?
I'm not just using prebuilt libraries â€” I'm **building DL from scratch** to really understand what's going on under the hood. This repo will be a log of:
- My projects
- Core concept breakdowns
- Clean and readable implementations  
Think of it as my public DL learning journal ðŸ““.

### ðŸš€ Stay tuned:
Iâ€™ll keep adding notebooks and code files as I explore topics like:
- Feedforward networks  
- Backpropagation  
- CNNs, RNNs, and more  
- PyTorch/TensorFlow implementations once the core is solid
